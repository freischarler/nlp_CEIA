      "Response:\n",
      "\n",
      "This argument is known as Pascal's Wager.  It has several flaws.\n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly, it does not indicate which religion to follow.  Indeed, there are\n",
      "many mutually exclusive and contradictory religions out there.  This is often\n",
      "described as the \"avoiding the wrong hell\" problem.  If a person is a\n",
      "follower of religion X, he may end up in religion Y's version of hell.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, the statement that \"If you believe in God and turn out to be\n",
      "incorrect, you have lost nothing\" is not true.  Suppose you're believing in\n",
      "the wrong God -- the true God might punish you for your foolishness.\n",
      "Consider also the deaths that have resulted from people rejecting medicine in\n",
      "favour of prayer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another flaw in the argument is that it is based on the assumption that \n",
      "the two possibilities are equally likely -- or at least, that they are of \n",
      "comparable likelihood.  If, in fact, the possibility of there being a God \n",
      "is close to zero, the argument becomes much less persuasive.  So sadly the\n",
      "argument is only likely to convince those who believe already.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, many feel that for intellectually honest people, belief is based on \n",
      "evidence, with some amount of intuition.  It is not a matter of will or \n",
      "cost-benefit analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Formally speaking, the argument consists of four statements:\n",
      "\n",
      "  1. One does not know whether God exists.\n",
      "  2. Not believing in God is bad for one's eternal soul if God does\n",

      "  It's now been almost one month since war broke out in the South\n",
      "Atlantic.  On the surface it seems that it's only a dispute\n",
      "between Argentina and Great Britain over the barren, wind-swept\n",
      "Falkland Islands and South Georgia Island.  In reality, it's far\n",
      "more than that.\n",
      "\n",
      "   The so-called Falklands crisis is just the visible tip of a\n",
      "giant military operation.  During this month of April 1982,\n",
      "fierce naval battles have taken place--not only in the South\n",
      "Atlantic but also in the South Pacific.  Up to now most of the\n",
      "hostilities have been kept under wraps by wartime censorship on\n",
      "all sides.  But as I say these words, the naval war in the\n",
      "Southern Hemisphere is about to come to the surface.\n",
      "\n",
      "   Beginning today, April 30, a total naval and air blockade of\n",
      "the Falklands by the Royal Navy has begun.  At the same time a\n",
      "counterblockade has been declared by Argentina in the same area.\n",
      "\n",
      "   To be effective, a blockade must be imposed over a period of\n",
      "time, but the Royal Navy does not have that much time.  Winter is\n",
      "coming on in the South Atlantic, and the British supply lines are\n",

      "\n",
      "Topic #1--When the Falkland Islands crisis began early this month\n",
      "it looked at first like a tempest in a teapot.  For a century and\n",
      "a half since 1833, the Islands have been controlled by Great\n",
      "Britain.  During that entire time, British sovereignty over the\n",
      "Falklands has been disputed by Argentina.  There have been\n",
      "countless threats by Argentina to seize the Islands, which it\n",
      "calls the Malvinas, but the threats have always come to nothing\n",
      "in the past and Britain has never even gotten very worried about\n",
      "them.\n",
      "\n",
      "   The Islands are four times as distant from Argentina as Cuba\n",
      "is from the United States, and they are not much of a prize. \n",
      "After 150 years of occupancy, the Falklands are home to fewer\n",
      "than 2,000 British settlers and a lot of sheep.  In short, the\n",
      "remote Falkland Islands hardly look like something to fight over,\n",
      "and yet here we are watching another crisis take place.  We are\n",
      "watching as war erupts between Great Britain and Argentina.\n",
      "\n",
      "   The Thatcher government is acting as if it has forgotten all\n",
      "about its usual preoccupation with the Soviet threat at NATO's\n",
      "doorstep.  Instead, Britain is throwing almost everything it's\n",
      "got at Argentina---aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers,\n",
      "submarines, assault ships--you name it.  Luxury cruise ships have\n",
      "even been commissioned and turned into troop carriers overnight. \n",
      "Wave after wave of additional assault troops have been activated\n",
      "and sent to join the fleet even after it sailed.  Ships and\n",
      "submarines have been pulled off station from normal NATO duty and\n",
      "sent to reinforce the task force.  The initial 40-ship force has\n",
      "grown steadily over the past several weeks into an armada\n",
      "numbering over 70.  Over two-thirds of the entire Royal Navy has\n",
      "already been deployed to the South Atlantic off Argentina.\n",
      "\n",
      "   Watching all this, a lot of people are asking: What's this\n",
      "fight really all about?  The most popular answer suggested in the\n",
      "major media is \"oil.\"  Vast deposits of oil are known to exist\n",
      "under the continental shelf between Argentina and the Falklands,\n",
      "but that has been known for nearly 10 years.  In no way does it\n",
      "explain the timing of the sudden military offensive by Argentina\n",
      "this month, and oil explains even less about the Argentine\n",
      "seizure of South Georgia Island.\n",
      "\n",
      "   South Georgia Island is 800 miles east of the Falklands with\n",
      "no known oil deposits anywhere near it; and compared to South\n",
      "Georgia, the Falklands are an island paradise.  South Georgia\n",
      "Island is covered with rugged mountains, treacherous valleys,\n",
      "glaciers, and semi-permanent snow.  Most of it is uninhabitable. \n",
      "On top of all that, Argentina has absolutely no legal or\n",
      "historical claim to South Georgia Island.  In that respect it\n",
      "stands in sharp contrast to the Falklands.\n",
      "\n",
      "   In the early 1830s the Falklands were occupied for a while by\n",
      "Argentine colonists.  In 1833 the British expelled them and took\n",
      "over the Island.  For that and other historical reasons,\n",
      "Argentina argues that the Falklands really belong to Argentina,\n",
      "not Britain.\n",
      "\n",
      "   But no such argument is possible for South Georgia Island.  It\n",
      "has always been controlled by Britain, never by Argentina or\n",
      "Spain.  The Argentine seizure of South Georgia Island looks even\n",
      "more unreasonable from a military point of view.  Argentina's\n",
      "leaders are military men and they think in military terms.  They\n",
      "were well aware ahead of time that far-off South Georgia Island\n",
      "could not possibly be held for long.  By seizing it they were\n",
      "setting themselves up to absorb a military defeat, as the Island\n",
      "was retaken by Britain.  So the question is: Why did Argentina's\n",
      "military junta bother with the seemingly worthless South Georgia\n",
      "Island at all?\n",
      "\n",
      "   My friends, the answers to all these questions are military,\n",
      "not political or economic.  South Georgia Island possesses an\n",
      "enormous military secret.  It's a giant underground installation\n",
      "buried under the mountains at the northwest end of the Island. \n",
      "The real reason for the so-called Falkland crisis is this secret\n",
      "installation, together with two other similar installations which\n",
      "I will describe shortly.\n",
      "\n",
      "   The secret military complexes have been in existence for many\n",
      "years; they are not new.  What is new is the accelerated nuclear\n",
      "war timetable of the American Bolshevik war planners here in\n",
      "Washington.  For the past two months I've been reporting the\n",
      "details of this new war plan to you as quickly as I can obtain\n",
      "and verify them.\n",

      "   The plan calls for NUCLEAR WAR ONE to erupt by September of\n",
      "this year 1982!!  It is this fast-approaching nuclear war threat\n",
      "that caused the so-called Falklands crisis to erupt now.\n",

      "Russia and the United States have been destroyed in NUCLEAR WAR\n",

      "Government war bunkers!  When the warring nations finally lie\n",
      "smoldering and exhausted, the Bolsheviks will leave the shattered\n",
      "remains of their host countries.  They will rendezvous at the\n",

      "NUCLEAR WAR ONE in a matter of months.  The Rockefeller cartel\n",
      "and Russia's new anti-Bolshevik rulers are working together in a\n",
      "race against time to try to head off the Bolshevik war plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "   Last month I mentioned that the Bolsheviks here are\n",
      "benefitting from war preparations which were started by the\n",
      "Rockefellers long ago.  It has only been about three years since\n",
      "the Rockefellers were dislodged as the prime movers of the United\n",
      "States Government by the Bolsheviks.  Since that time the United\n",
      "States Government has been a house divided, torn by internal\n",
      "power struggles between rival Bolshevik and Rockefeller factions. \n",
      "But before that, the United States had been dominated for decades\n",
      "both economically and politically by the Four Rockefeller\n",
      "Brothers.\n",
      "\n",
      "   In 1961 the Brothers launched a new long-range plan for world\n",
      "domination.  It was a two-prong strategy, half visible and half\n",
      "secret, which I first described long ago in AUDIO LETTER No. 28. \n",
      "It was a plan for the United States to arm to the teeth in secret\n",
      "while appearing to disarm gradually.  Without repeating all the\n",
      "details, the basic idea was grandiose yet simple.  By\n",
      "deliberately appearing weak, the Rockefeller-controlled United\n",
      "States would maneuver itself into a nuclear war with Russia. \n",
      "Then the secret weapons, including superweapons, would be\n",
      "unleashed to smash Russia and take over the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "   When they set the grand plan in motion in 1961, the\n",
      "Rockefeller Brothers were looking ahead to a nuclear war by the\n",
      "late 1970s.  Their military analysts concluded very early that\n",
      "the war being planned would have very different effects on the\n",
      "Northern and Southern Hemispheres.  Both superpowers, the United\n",
      "States and the Soviet Union, are located well up in the Northern\n",
      "Hemisphere; so are the other full-fledged nuclear powers--Great\n",
      "Britain, France, Red China, and India.  By contrast, the\n",
      "strategic targets for nuclear war in the Southern Hemisphere are\n",
      "relatively few and far between.  In other words, it was expected\n",
      "that the coming nuclear war would be essentially a Northern\n",
      "Hemisphere war.\n",
      "\n",
      "   In an all-out nuclear holocaust it is known that serious\n",
      "radioactive fallout will gradually spread to affect even areas\n",
      "not initially hit by war.  But there are limits to how far the\n",
      "war clouds can spread.  It was discovered long ago that there is\n",
      "very little mixing between the air of the Northern and Southern\n",
      "Hemispheres.  In the northern half of our planet, cold air from\n",
      "the North Pole works its way southward towards the equator, then\n",
      "it works its way back to the north as warm air.  A mirror image\n",
      "of this process takes up the southern half of the planet. \n",
      "Northern and Southern Hemisphere air meet in the equatorial zone,\n",
      "but very little of the air changes places.\n",
      "\n",
      "   The military conclusion, my friends, is this: the coming\n",
      "nuclear war could ruin large areas of the Northern Hemisphere for\n",
      "generations to come; but if the calculations are right, the\n",
      "Southern Hemisphere could escape virtually unaffected by the war. \n",
      "This was music to the ears of the Four Rockefeller Brothers.  A\n",
      "quick look at the globe of the world shows why.  The Rockefeller\n",
      "cartel has dominated Latin America ever since World War II.  As I\n",
      "discussed in my very first monthly AUDIO LETTER, Nelson\n",
      "Rockefeller solidified the cartel grip on Latin America during\n",
      "the war.  He accomplished this as so-called \"Coordinator of\n",
      "Hemispheric Defense\" for then-President Franklin D. Roosevelt. \n",
      "So that takes care of the South American continent and its\n",
      "natural resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "   Then there is the African continent.  There, too, Rockefeller\n",
      "control was already in effect over wide areas of Black Africa,\n",
      "especially south of the equator.  All this was thanks to the\n",
      "efforts of John D. Rockefeller III, as I detailed in AUDIO LETTER\n",
      "No. 36.\n",
      "\n",
      "   Looking around the globe, the most important remaining land\n",
      "masses from the standpoint of world domination are Australia and\n",
      "New Zealand.  Thanks to World War II, both were wide open to the\n",
      "Rockefellers.\n",
      "\n",
      "   The Rockefeller Brothers decided to establish secret military\n",
      "installations in the Southern Hemisphere for use after the coming\n",
      "war.  By this means they expected to become the masters of the\n",
      "surviving southern half of planet Earth after the Northern\n",
      "Hemisphere war.  Then, as the Northern Hemisphere gradually\n",
      "recovered from the nuclear holocaust, the Rockefeller empire\n",
      "would be able to pick up the pieces.  In this way the third\n",
      "generation Rockefeller Brothers expected their family dynasty to\n",
      "inherit the Earth.\n",
      "\n",
      "   In order to control the Southern Hemisphere militarily after\n",
      "the war, some means would have to be available to project\n",
      "military power onto any land mass.  For example, revolts against\n",
      "Rockefeller domination would require troops--not a blast from the\n",
      "beam weapons on the Moon.  The most critical factor for postwar\n",
      "military domination of the world was found to be a navy.  A\n",
      "minimum of two secret naval fleets would be required--one based\n",
      "in the South Atlantic, the other in the South Pacific.  Since the\n",
      "reserve naval fleets were to be kept secret until after the\n",
      "Northern Hemisphere nuclear war, they could not be built in\n",
      "existing shipyards.  New construction facilities had to be built\n",
      "and they had to be hidden.  To hide an entire shipyard is no\n",
      "small task; they take up a lot of space.  On top of that, it was\n",
      "essential that the ships remain hidden after they were built. \n",
      "The best way to achieve that was to combine the shipyard and\n",
      "naval base into one over-all secret installation.  Finally, the\n",
      "secret naval installation had to be invulnerable to nuclear\n",
      "attack; otherwise if its existence were ever discovered\n",
      "prematurely, the secret navy might be wiped out.\n",
      "\n",
      "   The combined requirements for secrecy, space, and protection\n",
      "against attack were formidable; but one day in 1959, while all\n",
      "these plans were still in the early stages of development, the\n",
      "answer presented itself.  During a so-called banking trip to\n",
      "Sweden, David Rockefeller was given a tour of a unique hidden\n",
      "naval port.  The port is hollowed out from solid granite cliffs\n",
      "which come right down to the water.  The entrance to the port is\n",
      "a gigantic hole in the side of the cliff which can be sealed off\n",
      "with enormous steel doors.  Inside this big doorway on the water\n",
      "a huge cavity has been hollowed out to accommodate ships.\n",
      "\n",
      "   The Rockefeller Brothers and their military adviser decided\n",
      "that a bigger, more secret, better protected version of the\n",
      "Swedish hidden port was just what they wanted.  A survey of\n",
      "candidate sites was then initiated.  The site survey covered\n",
      "coastal areas throughout the Southern Hemisphere.  Many areas\n",
      "were rejected very quickly because the topography was wrong. \n",
      "Other areas were rejected because they were too close to the\n",
      "equator.  Still others had to be ruled out because there were too\n",
      "many people living nearby, making the desired level of secrecy\n",
      "impossible.  Finally, it was essential that the sites chosen for\n",
      "the secret naval installations be totally secure politically.\n",
      "\n",
      "   At last the sites for the secret naval installations were\n",
      "selected.  In the South Pacific, extreme southern New Zealand was\n",
      "selected.  This is what I was alluding to in AUDIO LETTER No. 71\n",
      "three months ago when I called attention to New Zealand's extreme\n",
      "importance in the coming war.\n",
      "\n",
      "   In order to obtain the necessary space, the secret New Zealand\n",
      "naval installation had to be divided up into two sites located\n",
      "close together.  One is at the extreme southwest tip of South\n",
      "Island where the mountain range known as the Southern Alps comes\n",
      "down virtually to the water's edge.  The other part of the\n",
      "installation is built into the northwest tip of Stewart Island,\n",
